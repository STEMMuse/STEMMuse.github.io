								<h3>From our mentees:
								</h3>
							</header>
							<ul>
								<li>"The support that my mentor gave me <b> immensely helped me figure out</b> where I wanted to go and how to get there"</li>
								<li>"This program is amazing as it’s given me <b>the opportunity to connect with my amazing mentor</b> and without this program I don’t think I would have been able to do this."</li>
								<li>"I feel a <b> larger sense of belonging</b>  than I did before the SAGES Mentorship Program; I feel like I have narrowed down the career field I want to be in and what I want to do after graduation (apply to graduate school). It was really helpful to have a mentor who is in graduate school right now and can help guide me as I discover my research interests and goals."
								</li>
								<li>"This program is <b> amazing </b> as it’s given me the opportunity to connect with my amazing mentor and without this program I don’t think I would have been able to do this."
								</li>
								<li>"I would <b> highly recommend </b>this program! I achieved my goal of becoming an undergraduate research assistant, became certified in CITI Training, became more exposed to qualitative data analysis, and more networking skills. I did feel supported by my mentor and received a lot of help for my applications and resume. My mentor taught me a lot about graduate school and research opportunities. I really appreciate this program as it helped me grow more as a student and person."
								</li>
								<li>"I did gain from this program what I hoped or expected I would; I gained a lot more research experience, networking skills, career planning, and resume-building insight."
								</li>
								<li>"<b> 10/10 would recommend everyone</b> sign up for the mentorship program. I have been in a lot of mentorship programs and events and this was by far the best and most organized. I loved that they gave us conversation topics every month and actually encouraged us to continue meeting."
								</li>
								<li>"The mentorship and support I have received through this program will have a <b> long-term impact </b> on my professional development, and this will be a <b> lasting professional relationship</b>."
								</li>

								<h3>From our mentors:
								</h3>
							</header>
							<ul>
								<li>"My mentee grew so much over the year. She earned and worked for a wonderful internship over the summer and did a great job at it. I am so <b> proud of her growth</b>."
								</li>
								<li>"<b>Conversation guidelines are GOLD</b> . They keep the meetings flowing and a lot of great conversation comes from them. They <b> set this mentoring program apart from others</b> I have participated in."
								</li>
								<li>"I used my network connections <b>to recommend my mentee to a paid internship </b> at a previous company I worked at."
								</li>
								<li> "Participating in this program has been so <b> fulfilling</b> and <b> valuable</b> for me. I observed <b> so much growth</b> from my mentee and looked forward to our monthly meetings. She was open and willing to try new things, asked great questions, and was very engaged throughout the year. I helped coach her to prepare for an internship interview which she was offered and accepted! It was really <b> exciting</b> and <b> rewarding </b> to see her develop and her confidence to grow. The conversation guidelines made our meetings flow really well and sparked a lot of great conversation."
								</li>
								<li>"I believe this mentorship program was <b> incredibly beneficial</b> to my mentee and me. I was able to assist my mentee with learning skills for applying to research programs, contacting faculty members for research jobs, and navigating the process of applying to graduate school. My mentee was successful in securing an REU at the Mayo Clinic last summer and has also been hired in a long-term research technician position as an undergraduate student in a lab on campus."
								</li>
								<li> “This program is a fantastic way to incorporate networking into your life while still studying in grad school. It offers an <b> amazing opportunity</b> to develop these communication skills that are <b> ESSENTIAL</b> after grad school for success. I wish I had been a student when SAGES was an active program!”
								</li>
								<li> “Improves community building, removes barriers between faculty and students/Postdocs, assists with networking and professional development!”
